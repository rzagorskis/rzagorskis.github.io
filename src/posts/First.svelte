      This is my first post on the site. I'm using direct html to create this. An idea was to just use markdown parsers.
      This is how modern static site builders works (such as jekyll). They take the markdown files and just generate an
      html output.

    <span
      >What is the value of using markdown? Markdown in its history is just that, a markdown. It does not specify how
      the content should be rendered. What this allows is then for the markdown to be as is, and have the content be
      rendered as wished.</span
